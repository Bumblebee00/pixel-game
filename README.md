# pixel-game
This is a script that makes a simulation of a "fight" between two colors. He creates a battlefield where each
square is a "solider" that changes color according to its neighbors : 
every enemy that touches one of its sides is a 25% more chance of changing color 
(example: if it is surrounded by enemies -> change color for sure, 
if it's surrounded by an ally and three enemies -> has 75% chance of changing color)
